# Python Socket Server-Client

This project demonstrates a basic server-client communication using Python sockets.

## Files

- `server.py`: The server application.
- `client.py`: The client application.

## How to Run

### Server

Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
  ```

### Client

Run the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
  ```

## Notes

-  It needs to be ensured that both the server and client are running on the same machine or network.
-  Adjust the `server_port` in both `server.py` and `client.py` if a different port needs to be used.
